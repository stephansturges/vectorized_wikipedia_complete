# vectorized_wikipedia_complete
This is a complete dump of English language Wikipedia vectorized with SBERT all-mpnet-base-v2

# What is the point? 

I created this to be able to insert ALL of Wikipedia in English into a Pinecone / vector database to enable AI chatbots to source content!

It was pretty cool, I was able to make my own plugin for chatGPT which would browse Wikipedia for FACTUAL answers about even the most obscure stuff that is not available directly from the model, allowing it to answer questions where the model just hallucinates random garbage.

# This repo contains:

1. some terrible code to convert a downloaded dump of wikipedia to plain text, then to JSON, then to clean up the JSONs, then make long JSONL files of the text
2. some terrible code to run SBERT from sentence-transformers, specifically model all-mpnet-base-v2 and create vector embeddings for each item in the JSON files
